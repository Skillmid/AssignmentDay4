 	<h1> Explain Forms</h1>
<br>
<h2> <b> Answer </b> </h2>
<br>
<p> Forms can be described as a web page on the internet that alows the user to input needed data for a certain purpose forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.</p>
<br>
<h3>Forms can be made up of standard graphical user interface elements:</h3>
<br>
	<h5>Text input — a simple text box that allows input of a single line of text (an alternative, password, is used for security purposes, in which the character typed in are invisible or replaced by symbols such as *)</h5>
	<h5>Radio — a radio button</h5>
	<h5>File — a file select control for uploading a file</h5>
	<h5>Reset — a reset button that, when activated, tells the browser to restore the values to their initial values.</h5>
	<h5>Submit — a button that tells the browser to take action on the form (typically to send it to a server)</h5>
	<h5>Textarea — much like the text input field except a textarea allows for multiple rows of data to be shown and entered</h5>
	<h5>Select — a drop-down list that displays a list of items a user can select from</h5>
