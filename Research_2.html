<h2> <b> Answer </b> </h2>
<br>
<p>Progressive design can be described as a web design strategy that makes an effort to create websites that are accessible to all devices, using a layered approach with a set of core principals stressing accessibility of content and functionality.</p>

<br>

	<h5>Content layer: This can be achived using HTML markup</h5>
	<h5>Presentation layer: This is the implementation of CSS and Styling</h5>
	<h5>Client-side scripting layer: This is the use of JavaScript or jQuery behavious</h5>
