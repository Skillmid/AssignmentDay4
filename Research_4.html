 	<h1> Explain Positioning</h1>
<br>
<h2> <b> Answer </b> </h2>
<br>
<p> Positioning allows us speak the same language with developers and helps make better design decisions. Compared to static design tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch) it's more complex as well, because the position depends on everything around it; scrolling, screen size and other factors. we have different types of position in the web</p>
<br>
<h3>Types of Positioning</h3>
<br>
	<h5>Static:Static is the default positioning type. Although the name suggests that nothing is moving it isn’t the case. Static means elements are static to the flow – if one moves, another will move as well. </h5>
	<h5>Absolute:Absolutely positioned elements don’t care much about the flow, meaning they live in their own universe and aren’t affected by anything around them.</h5>
	<h5>Relative:Relatively positioned elements behave exactly like static ones, but they serve as a local frame of reference for absolutely positioned child elements. </h5>
	<h5>Fixed:Fixed means the position will always be locked to the size of the browser's window (viewport).</h5>
